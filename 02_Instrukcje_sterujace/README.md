Exam results:

1. Jan: 30 points.
1. Thomas: 10 points.
1. Michael: 16 points.

## Task 2
Write a program that, based on the value of the variable `n`, prints all numbers from `zero to n (inclusive)`.

For each number, the program should state whether the number is even or odd:

0 – even
1 – odd
2 – even
3 – odd
etc.

## Task 3

Using a loop, display on the console (variable `cake`) a birthday cake for each year of your life.
